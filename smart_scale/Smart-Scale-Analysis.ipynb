    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virginia Smart Scale methodology was finalized in November 2017 in order to provide an objective scoring system for the state's transportation projects competing for funding. The complete technical specification of the Smart Scale methodology can be found in the November 2017 technical guide, found here: [http://vasmartscale.org/documents/20171115/ss_technical_guide_nov13_2017.pdf](http://vasmartscale.org/documents/20171115/ss_technical_guide_nov13_2017.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to 1) provide some descriptive statistics of recently funded projects, and 2) to independently assess whether the Smart Scale scores (SSS) assigned to these projects were consistent with the Smart Scale methodology specified in the technical guide. This analysis uses a dataset provided by the Fredericksburg Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (FAMPO), containing data on 404 projects. This analysis uses the R statistical computing environment within a Jupyter notebook. This allows the analysis to be both explained as well as executed and allows complete transparancy of the analytical methodology. This removes any ambiguity and also guarantees reproducibility of the results.\n",

    "## II. Data Inspection and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was provided in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. This was first converted to a CSV file (ss-data.csv) and then a number of transformation processes were applied to clean and scale the data as well as to impute missing values. To begin, we first define several functions which will be used in the data transformation:"

Within the data there are four area types: A, B, C, and D. Each of these area types has a unique factor weighting that results in its Smart Scale Score. These weightings are specified for each area in Table 4.2 on page 36 within the technical guide. It is noted that for areas C and D, the Land Use factor is not used (or equivalently, carries 0% weight). Upon inspection of the whole dataset it was apparent that this was represented by empty cells for projects falling within these areas. Accordingly, all such Land Use values are set to 0. By this precedent it also is taken that all empty cells in numeric columns correspond to zero. Accordingly, a value of zero is imputed to all empty cells.\n",

As previously discussed, in the technical guide (Table 4.2, p. 36) there are six major factors used to compute the Smart Scale score which are themselves calculated from more basic measurements:\n",

Within the data there are four area types: A, B, C, and D. Each of these area types has a unique factor weighting that results in its Smart Scale Score. These weightings are specified for each area in Table 4.2 on page 36 within the technical guide. It is noted that for areas C and D, the Land Use factor is not used (or equivalently, carries 0% weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "The examination of scoring consistency will be done in two parts. First, the SSS will be independently calculated according to the specifications in the technical guide. These independently-calculated smart scale scores will then be compared to the scores provided in the dataset, and the deviations will be examined. In the second part, the best-fit factor weightings will be determined using constrained linear regression and compared to what is specified in the technical guide. Finally, an assessment as to whether the evidence suggests consistent or inconsistent scoring will be made.\n",

In the dataset all basic measurements needed for each factor weight calculation is present except for those pertaining to the Land Use factor. Instead, a Land Use factor score is provided. The final Smart Scale score is determined by a weighted average of the six factors, and these weightings differ depending on which area type the project falls within. All steps in the calcuation process are summarized in Table 4.6 on p. 40.\n",
